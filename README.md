# GAUSS blog
This repository houses the code and data to accompany the [Aptech **GAUSS** blogs](https://www.aptech.com/blog/).  The blogs cover a variety of GAUSS topics including programming, best practices, time series, econometrics, graphics, and more.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
These program files require a working copy of **GAUSS 18+**. Many can be run on earlier versions with some small revisions.

### Installing
Installation instructions for the individual codes are provided in blog-specific README files.
