# GAUSS blog: Cluster-robust standard errors
This code accompanies the Aptech blog [Apples to Apples: The case for cluster-robust standard errors ](https://www.aptech.com/blog/apples-to-apples-the-case-for-cluster-robust-standard-errors/) which was published on 12/10/2018.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
The program files require a working copy of **GAUSS 18+**. Many can be run on earlier versions with some small revisions.

## Data
The data used in the blog is contained in on file:
1. [apples_cluster.dat](apples_cluster.dat) - This file contains the hypothetical apple production data used in the blog.  

## Example files
Three program files are included:
1. [clusterse_blog](clusterse_blog.e) - This file contains the cluster-robust standard errors example found in the blog.
