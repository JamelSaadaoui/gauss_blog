# GAUSS blog: Repeating simulations from older versions
This code accompanies the Aptech blog [Repeating simulations from older versions of GAUSS](https://www.aptech.com/blog/repeating-simulations-from-older-versions-of-gauss/) which was published on 10/05/2018.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
The program files require a working copy of **GAUSS 18+**. Many can be run on earlier versions with some small revisions.

## Example files
Three program files are included:
1. [example1.e](example1.e) - This file contains an example of loading dates using the `date` keyword with the `loadd` procedure.
2. [example2.e](example2.e) - This file contains an example of loading dates using a custom function with the `loadd` procedure.
3. [bike_count.xlsx](bike_count.xlsx) - This file contains the data used in [example1.e](example1.e).
4. [temperature.csv](temperature.csv )- This file contains the data used in [example2.e](example2.e).
