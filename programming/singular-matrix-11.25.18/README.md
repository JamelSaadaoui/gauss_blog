# GAUSS blog: Diagnosing a singular matrix
This code accompanies the Aptech blog [Diagnosing a singular matrix](https://www.aptech.com/blog/diagnosing-a-singular-matrix/) which was published on 11/25/2018.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
The program files require a working copy of **GAUSS 18+**. Many can be run on earlier versions with some small revisions.

## Example files
Three program files are included:
1. [singular_model.e](singular_model.e) - This file contains the model which results in a singular matrix error.
2. [diagnostics.e](diagnostics.e) - This file contains diagnostic tests for finding the cause of the singular matrix.
3. [final_model.e](final_model.e) - This file contains the final model which remedies the singular matrix issues based on the diagnostic testing.
3. [golf_ballflight.csv](golf_ballflight.csv) - This file contains the data used in [singular_model.e](singular_model.e), [diagnostics.e](diagnostics.e) and [final_model.e](final_model.e).
