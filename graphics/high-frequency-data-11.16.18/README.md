# GAUSS blog: Graphing high frequency data
This code accompanies the Aptech blog [Graph high frequency Forex data](https://www.aptech.com/blog/graph-high-frequency-forex-data/) which was published on 11/16/2018.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
The program files require a working copy of **GAUSS 18+**. Many can be run on earlier versions with some small revisions.

## Example files
Three program files are included:
1. [example1.e](example1.e) - This file contains an example of plotting high frequency Forex data using default graph formatting.
2. [example2.e](example2.e) - This file contains an example of using a `plotControl` structure to format a graph of high frequency Forex data.
3. [usdcad_tick.csv](usdcad_tick.csv) - This file contains the data used in [example1.e](example1.e) and [example2.e](example2.e).
