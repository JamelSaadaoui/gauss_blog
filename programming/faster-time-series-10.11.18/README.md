# GAUSS blog: Making time series code faster
This code accompanies the Aptech blog [Make your time series computations up to 20 times faster](https://www.aptech.com/blog/make-your-time-series-computations-up-to-20-times-faster/) which was published on 10/11/2018.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
The program files require a working copy of **GAUSS 18+**. Many can be run on earlier versions with some small revisions.

## Example files
Three program files are included:
1. [example1.e](example1.e) - This file contains an example of using vectorized multiplication versus element-by-element multiplication.
2. [simulating_ar.e](simulating_ar.e) - This file contains an example of simulating AR data using element-by-element operations.
3. [simulating_recserar.e](simulating_recserar.e) - This file contains an example of using `recserar` to speed up the simulation of AR data.
