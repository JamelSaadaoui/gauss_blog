# GAUSS blog: One-way individual effects
This code accompanies the Aptech blog [Panel Data Basics: One-way Individual Effects](https://www.aptech.com/blog/panel-data-basics-one-way-individual-effects/) which was published on 04/14/2019.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
The program files require a working copy of **GAUSS 18+**. Many can be run on earlier versions with some small revisions.
In also requires installation of the `pdlib` [GAUSS panel data library](https://github.com/aptech/gauss-panel-library).

## Example files
Two program files are included:
1. [fixed-effects.e](fixed-effects.e) - This file contains the code for manually computing the within-group fixed effects estimation and using the `fixedEffects` procedure.
2. [random-effects.e](random-effects.e) - This file contains the code for using the `randomEffects` procedure.
3. [simple_data.dat](simple_data.dat) - This file contains the data used in the [fixed-effects.e](fixed-effects.e) and [randome-effects.e](random-effects.e) files.
