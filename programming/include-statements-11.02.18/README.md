# GAUSS blog: Using #include statements
This code accompanies the Aptech blog [What you need to know about #include](https://www.aptech.com/blog/what-you-need-to-know-about-include/) which was published on 10/05/2018.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
The program files require a working copy of **GAUSS 18+**. Many can be run on earlier versions with some small revisions.

## Example files
Three program files are included:
1. [hypotenuse.gss](hypotenuse) - This file contains the procedure `hypotenuse` and an example use of hypotenuse in one file.
2. [main.gss](main.gss) - This files calls the procedure `hypotenuse` and uses a #include statement to include the procedure definition found in the file *hypotenuse.src*.
3. [hypotenuse.src](hypotenuse.src) - This file the definition of the procedure `hypotenuse`.
