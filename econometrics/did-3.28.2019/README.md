# GAUSS blog: Difference-in-differences
This code accompanies the Aptech blog [Introductionn to Difference-in-Differences](https://www.aptech.com/blog/the-basics-of-quantile-regression/) which was published on 03/29/2019.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
The program files require a working copy of **GAUSS 18+**. Many can be run on earlier versions with some small revisions.

## Example files
Two program files are included:
1. [did_calculations.gss](did_calculations.gss) - This file contains the code for computing the difference-in-differences calculations reported in the blog.
2. [did_plots.gss](did_plots.gss) - This file produces the plot included in the blog.
