# GAUSS blog: Quantile Regression
This code accompanies the Aptech blog [The Basics of Quantile Regression](https://www.aptech.com/blog/the-basics-of-quantile-regression/) which was published on 01/20/2019.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
The program files require a working copy of **GAUSS 18+**. Many can be run on earlier versions with some small revisions.

## Example files
Three program files are included:
1. [quantile_regression.e](quantile_regression.e) - This file contains the code for running the quantile regressions performed in the blog.
2. [islr_hitters.xlsx](islr_hitters.xlsx) - This file contains the data used in quantile regression.
